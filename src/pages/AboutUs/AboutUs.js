                <h3>Purpose</h3>
                <p>he purpose of this paper is to explore the current status  of HACCP across the food chain with particular reference to the hospitality industry. It is the first article in the second Worldwide Hospitality and Tourism Themes issue of the International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management presenting a new method of HACCP for the hospitality industry and proof of its utility.</p>
                <br />
                <br />
                <h3>Design/methodology/approach</h3>
                <p>An extensive review of HACCP literature is presented with an in‐depth analysis of both established and innovative methodologies. It is set in the context of both international efforts to meet the needs of small and less developed businesses (SLDBs) and recent UK Government initiatives.</p>
                <br />
                <br />
                <h3>Findings</h3>
                <p>Research confirms anecdotal evidence that whilst HACCP development is widespread in large food manufacturers its use is limited within smaller businesses, with particularly slow progress in the hospitality sector. Recent in‐depth psychological methods have led to the identification of 11 implementation barriers that need to be addressed if businesses are to meet the ever‐demanding legal requirements. It is suggested that the method of applying HACCP principles, developed for large manufacturing businesses, is inappropriate for the hospitality industry and that a new method is required.</p>
